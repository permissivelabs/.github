  <h1>Permissive</h1>
</div>
<p>Permissive is an authorization framework built with Account Abstraction (ERC-4337). It allows services to request specific permissions from users. Once a service has been granted the required permissions, it can perform allowed actions on behalf of the user in the form of UserOperations. The Permissive stack is simple: it consists of one account smart contract, one authorization page (e.g. https://app.permissive.dev) on which the user grants permissions by sending a transaction, and an SDK for developers to build on top of Permissive.</p>
